# EX-8-ADVANCED-ENCRYPTION-STANDARD-DES-ALGORITHM
# Aim:
To use Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) Algorithm for a practical application like URL Encryption.

# ALGORITHM:
AES is based on a design principle known as a substitution–permutation.
AES does not use a Feistel network like DES, it uses variant of Rijndael.
It has a fixed block size of 128 bits, and a key size of 128, 192, or 256 bits.
AES operates on a 4 × 4 column-major order array of bytes, termed the state
